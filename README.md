# Regression-Project
Todayâ€™s businesses are constantly seeking ways to leverage data to improve decision-making and forecasting. Regression analysis is a powerful statistical tool that is used to understand the relationships between variables, understand past trends, and predict future outcomes. The purpose of this project is to conduct a time series regression analysis to predict store sales at Corporation Favorita, a major grocery retailer based in Ecuador. The objective is to develop a robust predictive model that utilizes time-dependent data to forecast unit sales for groceries in Favorita stores. Applying regression techniques, this analysis aims to understand the relationship between sales and key factors such as promotions and other variables. Through modeling and analysis of temporal patterns, the goal is to enhance the accuracy of sales predictions and gain actionable insights for optimizing business strategies.
