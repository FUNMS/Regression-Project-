##### **Problem Statement**:

Today's competitive market leverages data effectively in making informed decisions and precise forecasts. Corporation Favorita, a grocery retailer in Ecuador, seeks to optimize its business strategies by utilizing time series regression analysis. The objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts unit sales based on historical data, including factors such as promotions and other variables. Through understanding patterns and relationships between variables, the goal is to enhance the accuracy of sales predictions and provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

##### **Analytical Questions**
1. Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?

2. Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year (excluding days the store was closed)?

3. Compare the sales for each month across the years and determine which month of which year had the highest sales.

4. Did the earthquake impact sales?

5. Are certain stores or groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)

6. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?

7. What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?

8. Which product family and stores did the promotions affect.

9. What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?)

10. Does the payment of wages in the public sector on the 15th and last days of the month influence the store sales.

##### **Scope and Constraint**:
- Assumption: Historical sales data is representative of future demand patterns.
- Constraint: Limited availability of real-time sales data for model training.


#### Additional Information

This project is to be completed in 4 weeks 

Objectives

Understand Regression Models: Learn about linear, multiple, and logistic regression models, their purposes, limitations, and the questions they can answer.

Correlation and Linear Association: Explore correlation analysis and methodologies for fitting the best line to data.

Interpretation of Regression Coefficients: Interpret coefficients in simple and multiple regression models, and understand statistical significance through p-values and confidence intervals.

Logistic Regression: Learn about logistic regression for estimating probabilities of binary outcomes and interpret odds ratios and predicted probabilities.

Time Series Analysis: Understand time series data, explore forecasting techniques, and evaluate forecast accuracy using metrics like MAE and MSE.

Practical Application: Collect, clean, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA); build and validate regression models using Python or R; apply models for business forecasts; and create visualizations and detailed reports.

Tools and Software: Use Python/R for data analysis and model building, Excel/Google Sheets for initial data analysis and visualization, and Tableau/Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.

#### Regression Models

##### Linear Regression

- Linear regression is a basic yet powerful tool for understanding relationships between variables. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable using a straight line.

##### Multiple Regression

 - Multiple regression extends linear regression by using multiple independent variables to predict a single dependent variable. This allows for more complex and accurate models.

##### Logistic Regression

- Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is binary. It estimates the probability of an event occurring by fitting data to a logistic curve.

##### Correlation and Linear Association

- Correlation analysis measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. Techniques like Pearson's correlation coefficient and scatter plots help in understanding these relationships.

##### Interpretation of Regression Coefficients
In regression models, coefficients represent the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable. Statistical significance of these coefficients is determined using p-values and confidence intervals.

#### Time Series Analysis

Components of Time Series Data

- Time series data consists of components like trend, seasonality, and noise. Understanding these components helps in better modeling and forecasting.

##### Forecasting Techniques

- Common forecasting techniques include moving averages, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA models. Each technique has its own strengths and is suitable for different types of data patterns.

##### Evaluating Forecast Accuracy

- Forecast accuracy is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). These metrics help in comparing and selecting the best forecasting models.


#### Business Understanding

#### Data Preparation

- Collect: Gather data from relevant sources.
- Clean: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data distribution and relationships through visualizations and summary statistics.

#### Model Building
Build Models: Use Python  build regression models.
Validate Models: Assess model performance using metrics like R-squared and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Forecasting and Decision Making
Apply Models: Use the built models to make business forecasts.
Scenario Analysis: Perform what-if analysis to understand the impact of different scenarios.

Communicate findings to stakeholders
